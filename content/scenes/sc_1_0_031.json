      "\"The Preservationists will tell you that stories are sacred. That changing them is destruction. They are not entirely wrong—there is wisdom in tradition, in the weight of what came before.\"",
      "They touch the door, and it swings open at their touch.",
      "\"The Revisionists will tell you that stories can be improved. That suffering is not a necessary plot device. They too are not entirely wrong—there is courage in revision, in refusing to accept cruelty as inevitable.\"",
      "Beyond the door, you see a corridor leading to light.",
      "\"The Exiters will tell you that fiction deserves reality. That characters should be free. Their cause is noble, but their means... complicated. The boundary exists for reasons.\"",
      "Maren turns back to you.",
      "\"And those who refuse to choose? They become something else. Witnesses. Observers. The problem with being a witness is that you can still be crushed by what you watch.\"",
      "The corridor pulses with amber light—the Threshold Stage, waiting.",
      "\"One final question, Prompter. Before you cross, before you meet the factions who will welcome you or fear you or try to use you—what do you want for yourself?\""
