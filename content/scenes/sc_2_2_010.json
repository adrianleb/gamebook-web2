      "You push through a velvet curtain into a corridor of doors, each marked with names in languages that shift when you try to focus on them.",
      "The first door stands slightly ajar. Inside, you glimpse a dressing room frozen mid-performance—costumes draped across furniture as if just discarded, a half-drunk cup of tea still steaming on a vanity. A name is scratched into the mirror: *Hamlet*.",
      "The second door reveals a room filled with mirrors, each reflecting a different version of the same woman. In one reflection, she wears a crown. In another, rags. In a third, nothing at all. The mirrors ripple as you pass.",
      "Deeper still, you find a room containing only a single chair and a script that writes itself. Words appear, vanish, and rearrange in patterns you almost understand—stories being drafted in real-time, discarded before they can be told.",
      "CHORUS whispers through the walls: \"*Every character has a room here. Every story has a space between performances. The Green Room remembers what audiences forget.*\"",
      "You feel the weight of countless narratives pressing against you—the joy, the tragedy, the endless cycle of performance and rest. These rooms are sanctuaries for those who exist only when called upon by storytellers.",
      "Turning back, you find the curtain leading to the main Green Room."
