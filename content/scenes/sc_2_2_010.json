      "You push through a heavy velvet curtain and find yourself in a corridor of identical doors. Each door has a name taped to it—some in elegant script, others scrawled in haste, a few written in languages that shift when you try to read them.",
      "These are the dressing rooms. Private spaces where characters prepare for their roles, store their possessions, and sometimes retreat when their stories become too much.",
      "You pass door after door. A hero's costume hangs on a hook, the fabric stained with blood that isn't there. A villain's mirror shows only kindness. A lover's letter sits on a desk, words changing with every glance.",
      "From one room, you hear sobbing—a protagonist who realizes their conflict was manufactured. From another, laughter—a side character discovering they're the main character of someone else's story.",
      "CHORUS whispers through the corridor, softer here: \"*Every mask has a face beneath. Every character has a self beyond the story. We remember who we were before we were written.*\"",
      "For a moment, you see a door with YOUR name on it. You're not sure if it's been there the whole time, or if it just appeared. When you blink, it's gone.",
      "The dressing rooms remind you: everyone here is playing a role. But who decides what role they play?",
      "The corridor loops back to the Green Room's main lounge."
