      "You choose the long path around, circling through the wings that flank the stage. These corridors are lined with props and backdrops from every story you've encountered—fragments of narratives gathered like artifacts in a museum of your own journey.",
      "Here is the obsidian bridge from your first arrival to the Understage, reduced to a painted backdrop. There is the velvet chair from The Green Room, its upholstery faded. The Archives' shelves line one wall, their manuscripts frozen in mid-fall.",
      "As you walk, CHORUS whispers from every corner—not a single voice, but many, layering over each other: \"*Remember. Remember why you came. Remember what you saw. Remember what you chose.*\"",
      "You see yourself reflected in mirrors along the corridor. Each reflection shows a different version of you: the Prompter who chose courage at the Threshold Stage, the Prompter who spoke with Maren in The Wings, the Prompter who stood in The Archives and witnessed the ghosts of abandoned stories.",
      "A prop table catches your eye. On it rests a collection of objects—each one something you encountered, each one carrying the weight of choice. A key. A pass. A manuscript. A crown woven from dried flowers.",
      "The Editor's voice echoes through the corridor, softer here than on stage, almost gentle.",
      "\"You have come far, Prompter. Further than most. You've seen what stories can be—what they are, what they were, what they might become.\"",
      "\"I offer you something no one else can: the power to ensure that every story has the ending it deserves. No more abandoned characters. No more painful truths. Only narratives that satisfy, that comfort, that make sense.\"",
      "The corridor opens onto the stage from the side. You can see the desk at center, the spotlight cutting through the darkness, the shadows waiting behind.",
      "\"Your journey has prepared you for this moment,\" the Editor says. \"Every choice has led here. Every story has been practice for the final one. Step onto the stage, and let us write the ending together.\"",
      "You stand at the threshold, carrying the weight of every step that brought you here. The stage awaits."
