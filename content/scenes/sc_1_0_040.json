      "They glance in the direction the escaped figure fled. \"That one won't stop running. Not until someone catches them—or until they run off the edge of the world. The Wings are full of stories like that. Characters who escaped their endings, scenes that refuse to complete, moments that stretch into eternity.\"",
      "The Stagehand shifts their burden, looking at you appraisingly. \"I could help you catch them. I know these corridors better than anyone. But I could also help you understand what you're really chasing. Why these characters escape. What they're running from. What they hope to find.\"",
      "They hold out a grease-stained hand. \"The Prompter's Handbook won't tell you everything. It won't tell you about the spaces between scenes, the moments between breaths, the stories that happen when no one is watching. But I will... for a price.\"",
      "The Stagehand's eyes glint with something—opportunity, or perhaps warning.",
