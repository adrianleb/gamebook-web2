Your heart hammers against your ribs. The resistance is absolute.\n\nYou cannot do it. Not yet. The fear is too old, too heavy, too real.\n\nYou stagger back from the threshold, gasping for air, your vision swimming. The iron door slams shut with a sound like breaking bone.\n\nThe Understage rejects you this day.\n\n--- VERTICAL SLICE COMPLETE ---\n\nYour courage was not sufficient to cross the threshold. The Preservationists note your hesitation.\n\nThank you for experiencing The Understage vertical slice.",
