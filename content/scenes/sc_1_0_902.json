You try to carry it with you, to push through, but the darkness does not yield.\n\nYour courage fails. The boundary rejects you.\n\nYou stumble back, gasping, as the amber light dims to a dull glow. The stage recedes into shadow. You are not yet ready to cross.\n\nA voice speaks from everywhere at once: \"THE PROMPTER MUST BE READY. RETURN WHEN YOU HAVE FOUND YOUR COURAGE.\"\n\n--- VERTICAL SLICE COMPLETE ---\n\nYour courage was insufficient. The Understage rejects those who cannot face the unknown.\n\nThank you for experiencing The Understage vertical slice.",
