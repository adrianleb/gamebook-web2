      "They rise, and their costume ripples through a dozen identities in moments: a court jester, a tragic heroine, a nameless guard, a child who appeared in one scene and never again.",
      "\"Some stories were abandoned by their authors. Real life intervened, or inspiration faded, or the story proved too difficult to complete. Those rest peacefully here, preserved in memory even if never fully told.\"",
      "The Understudy's expression darkens. \"But others... others were taken. The Editor discovers stories deemed unworthy—too sad, too strange, too problematic by whatever standard they apply that week. And those stories are unmade, their characters scattered, their settings erased.\"",
      "\"We Preservationists believe every story deserves to exist, even the painful ones. Without sadness, joy has no context. Without failure, triumph means nothing. The Editor would create a world of perfect narratives, sterile and safe. But what kind of story is that?\"",
      "They lean closer, and for a moment you see the weight of every role they've never played reflected in their eyes.",
      "\"I am The Understudy. I am what remains when characters are cut. I am the lines spoken in rehearsal but never performed. I am the backup plan, the reserve option, the one chosen only when the first choice fails. And I am tired of watching stories disappear.\"",
      "The Understudy steps back, their costume settling on something neutral—a gray robe that could be anything or nothing.",
      "\"If you seek to understand what the Editor truly plans, visit The Author's Desk at the heart of the Archives. But know this: what you find there cannot be unseen. Stories abandoned leave wounds in reality itself.\""
