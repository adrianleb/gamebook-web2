      "\"The Guide is the first face a Prompter sees. They wait in shadow, offer keys and cryptic advice, and vanish when their duty is done. I have been the Guide for three hundred Prompters. I have watched them rise and fall, succeed and fail, live and die.\"",
      "The handwriting shifts, becomes unsteady.",
      "\"I was once a Prompter myself. In the time before the Threshold Theatre had a name. Before the Understage was divided into Acts and Hubs. When the stories were wilder, and the cost of guiding them was... higher.\"",
      "\"I failed my crossing. The Editor spared me, gave me this duty instead. A mercy? Or a punishment? Three centuries of watching others attempt what I could not. Three hundred Prompters, and only a handful have truly understood.\"",
      "You realize the figure in shadow is watching you. Has been watching you read.",
      "\"We are more alike than you know,\" they say. Their voice carries something new—an ancient weariness, a weight of countless failures. \"I too sought to understand the stories. I too believed I could save them all. I was wrong.\"",
      "They lean forward into the candlelight. Their face is still shifting, still indeterminate, but for a moment you see eyes that have witnessed everything and forgotten nothing.",
      "\"The handbook will tell you many things. It will not tell you what matters most: when to hold on, and when to let go.\"",
      "The candle flares. When your vision clears, the figure is back in shadow. The handbook lies open before you, waiting for your choice."
