      "The shelves extend in all directions, a maze of manuscript-filled corridors that seem to shift when you're not looking directly at them. Each aisle is labeled with titles that make your eyes water: *Cut Chapters*, *Abandoned Arcs*, *Characters Who Never Were*.",
      "You pull a manuscript from a shelf marked *Alternate Endings*. The pages contain a version of a familiar story, but everything after chapter three is different—the hero dies, the villain wins, the love story ends in separation. As you read, the words fade, replaced by the official version you know.",
      "Deeper in the Stacks, you find shelves labeled *Draft Zero*—raw, unpolished versions of stories with crossed-out passages visible even here. A character who exists only in this draft waves at you from the margins, their form flickering like a bad connection.",
      "You pass a section where the manuscripts are bound in black cloth. A sign reads: *Stories Removed by Editorial Decree*. The air here is cold, and the shelves seem to recede when you approach them, as if even the Archives itself is afraid of what they contain.",
      "A page drifts down from above. On it is written a single line: *\"They are not gone. They are waiting.\"* The handwriting changes three times before your eyes.",
      "The rustling sound grows louder—like countless pages turning simultaneously, like stories trying to speak all at once. For a moment, you see figures moving between the shelves, transparent and flickering. Characters cut from their own narratives, still seeking their endings.",
      "The path back to the Archives Entry glows faintly, a reminder that not all explorations should continue indefinitely."
