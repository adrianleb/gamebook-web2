      "The Stacks rise around you like a cathedral built from paper. Row after row of shelves stretches into darkness, each aisle a narrow canyon of forgotten stories.",
      "You wander deeper, running your fingers along spines that crumble at your touch. Some manuscripts are bound in leather that smells of forgotten libraries. Others are stitched together with thread that glimmers faintly, as if the material itself remembers being part of something larger.",
      "A passage catches your eye: \"The hero stepped forward, but the path had changed. Where a door had stood, now there was only wall. The author had decided this wasn't the kind of story that had exits.\" The text ends there, crossed out in furious red ink.",
      "Another shelf holds what appears to be a complete novel, but every page after chapter three is blank. A note in the margin reads: \"Lost interest. Started something else.\" The characters in chapter three seem to know—you can feel their frozen mid-action, waiting for a conclusion that will never come.",
      "Deeper in the Stacks, you find shelves organized by emotion. Entire sections devoted to stories that were \"too sad\" or \"too strange\" or \"simply didn't work out.\" The books here hum with restless energy, their pages trembling as you pass.",
      "A whisper brushes past your ear—not a voice, but the echo of one. A character who never got to speak their lines. Another whisper joins it, then another. The Stacks are full of ghosts, and they notice when someone walks among them.",
      "At the end of one aisle, you discover a manuscript that seems to be about you. The description matches your arrival in the Understage, your progress through the hubs. But the text is incomplete. The page ends mid-sentence: \"And then the Prompter would have to—\"",
      "The rest is torn away.",
      "The shelves loom around you, patient and ancient. Whatever secrets the Archives hold, they're buried somewhere in these endless corridors of abandoned narrative."
