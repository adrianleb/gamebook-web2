      "They move to a set of scratches. \"Here, a Prompter who tried to claw their way back to reality. They didn't understand that the only way out is through. They spent weeks trying to dig through the stage floor, as if the real world lay just beneath the wood.\"",
      "They stop before a dark stain. \"And here... the most tragic mark of all. A Prompter who stood in this spot and refused to move. For years. They became a statue, a monument to their own fear. Sometimes, late at night, new Prompters report seeing them—a figure standing at center stage, weeping silently, frozen forever.\"",
