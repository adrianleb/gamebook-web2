      "The Director turns fully from the mirror, their features settling into something almost human—an ageless face with eyes that have watched countless curtain calls.",
      "\"You have questions. Every Prompter does, in the beginning.\" They gesture to a velvet-upholstered chair. \"Sit. The Green Room has witnessed many such conversations, and yours will not be the last.\"",
      "You sit. The Director leans against the vanity, hands clasped behind their back.",
      "\"The Understage exists because stories need a place to breathe between performances. Here, characters rest when not called upon by storytellers. CHORUS—those whispers you hear in the mirrors—is the collective voice of every character who has ever existed in fiction. They remember every story. Every ending. Every possibility.\"",
      "The Director's expression grows somber. \"But the Understage is changing. The Editor—a being of immense power—seeks to revise reality itself. Some here support this vision. Others resist. Still others believe fiction should merge with reality, letting characters walk among your kind.\"",
      "\"Three factions,\" the Director counts on their fingers. \"Preservationists, who would keep worlds separate. Revisionists, who would rewrite stories to eliminate suffering. Exiters, who would merge fiction and reality entirely. Each believes they serve the greater good. Each would ask for your alliance.\"",
      "\"I will not tell you which path to choose. That is your burden as Prompter. But know this: the Editor's Great Revision approaches, and your choice will determine what becomes of stories themselves.\"",
      "The Director straightens. \"I have said enough for now. Return when you have seen more of the Understage—or when you are ready to choose a side.\""
