      "You saw it—the truth behind the Editor, behind the Understage, behind stories themselves.",
      "The Editor is not a curator or a guardian. They are a symptom. The Understage is not a sanctuary—it is a wound in reality's fabric, a place where stories accumulate like scar tissue.",
      "And the Great Revision? It is not a new beginning. It is an ending—the moment the wound heals, whether we want it to or not.",
      "\"There is another way,\" you say, and the Editor actually looks at you for the first time.",
      "\"The wound can be healed completely. No Understage. No stories crossing into reality. No boundary to maintain. Just... reality, as it was before stories began.\"",
      "Silence stretches across the infinite stage.",
      "\"That would mean the end of every story ever told,\" the Editor says softly. \"Characters, worlds, narratives—all gone. Not archived. Not preserved. Gone.\"",
      "\"But the wound would heal.\"",
      "\"Yes. And no new stories would ever emerge from reality's imagination again.\"",
      "You consider this. A world without stories. A reality that cannot dream of itself through fiction. Peaceful, yes. Safe, certainly. But also... blank.",
      "It is a choice, you realize. Peace through the end of stories. Or the endless conflict that narratives bring.",
      "\"What do you choose, Prompter?\"",
      "Your answer hangs in the crystalline air.",
