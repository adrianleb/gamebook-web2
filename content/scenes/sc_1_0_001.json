      "The darkness is absolute. A crushing weight of silence, as if the entire world has been holding its breath for a very long time.",
      "Then—a flicker. A single candle flares to life on a cramped wooden desk before you. Its flame dances uncertainly, illuminating walls covered in layer upon layer of yellowed posters, playbills, and notes scribbled in a hundred different hands.",
      "You sit in a high-backed chair that's seen better decades. This is the Prompter's Booth—the hidden heart of the Threshold Theatre, though you have no memory of how you arrived. Your name, your history, the world beyond these walls... all distant echoes, faded almost to nothing.",
      "Before you lies a leather-bound handbook: THE PROMPTER'S GUIDE TO THE UNDERSTAGE. Beside it, a heavy iron door set into the far wall—its lock rusted shut, handle immovable.",
      "The candle flame leans toward an opening to your right. To your left, a figure sits in shadow, watching you with patient, knowing eyes.",
      "You are the Prompter. And somewhere beyond this booth, stories are waiting."
