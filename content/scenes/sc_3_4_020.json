      "You circle around the stage through the wings—the hidden corridors where actors wait for their cues, where props are stored, where the machinery of theater operates unseen by the audience.",
      "Here in the wings, shadows have substance. They cluster around you, taking shapes you've come to recognize over your journey through the Understage.",
      "The Director steps forward from the darkness, their features shifting through every role they've never played. The Understudy materializes beside them, holding a script that seems to write and unwrite itself continuously.",
      "From the shadows behind them, others emerge—faint, flickering figures. A Revisionist scribe with ink-stained hands. An Exiter dreamer whose edges blur into nothingness. Representatives of the factions you've encountered, gathered at the threshold of the final act.",
      "\"You chose allies,\" The Director says, and their voice sounds like many voices layered together. \"Now those allies stand with you. The Editor's power is vast, but unity is something they cannot revise away.\"",
      "The Understudy speaks next: \"The Editor believes stories are theirs to control. We know better. Stories belong to themselves, to the characters who live them, to the audiences who witness them. Your alliance proves this.\"",
      "The shadowy figures around you nod in unison—a chorus of agreement from every faction you've aligned with.",
      "\"We cannot fight for you in the final scene,\" The Director continues. \"But we can lend you strength. The Editor will offer you a choice. Remember why you chose your path. Remember who stands with you in the wings.\"",
      "One by one, the shadow figures press close, and you feel their resolve flowing into you—certainty, clarity, purpose. When they step back, you feel less alone than you ever have.",
      "\"The stage awaits,\" The Understudy says. \"The Editor will hear your story now. Make it one worth remembering.\""
