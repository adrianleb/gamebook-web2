      "\"The original ending,\" she breathes. \"Where the apprentice chooses duty over desire. The Revisionists wanted to change it—something about 'modern audiences needing hope.' But some stories must stand as written.\"",
      "She stamps the pages with a wax seal—the Preservationist mark. \"You understand. Stories have weight. Change them carelessly, and the entire production collapses. The Understage remembers every alteration.\"",
      "She hands you a heavy iron key. \"The Sealed Archive. You've earned access. The first drafts of every Understage story are kept there—some things even the Editor doesn't want performers to remember.\"",
      "The key is warm in your hand. You've preserved something true today. But the weight of it settles in your chest—preservation means holding onto things others might want to forget."
