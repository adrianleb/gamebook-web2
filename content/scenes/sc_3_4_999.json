      "\"I see,\" they say simply.",
      "The Mainstage begins to shift. The ghostlight brightens, then dims, then brightens again in cycles that feel almost like breathing.",
      "The machinery of the flies moves—ropes descending and ascending in patterns that repeat without variation. The orchestra pit hums, then falls silent, then hums again.",
      "\"Every story must end,\" The Editor says. \"But if the author cannot write the ending...\"",
      "They gesture, and you understand.",
      "Rehearsal.",
      "The Mainstage becomes a rehearsal space that will never see opening night. The Green Room becomes a waiting room for a performance that will never begin. The Archives fill with drafts that will never be finalized.",
      "You remain the Prompter—guiding, suggesting, nudging—but never concluding. Every scene you shape leads to another scene. Every choice you make leads to another choice.",
      "The Editor is still here, still waiting, still offering the choice you refused.",
      "\"Perhaps tomorrow,\" they say. \"Perhaps the next time through. Perhaps eventually.\"",
      "And so it goes.",
      "Days pass. Years. Eons. Time has no meaning in the Understage.",
      "You guide stories through their beginnings, their middles. You help characters find their voices, their motivations, their paths. But when the time comes for endings—for resolution, for closure—you step back.",
      "You cannot choose. You will not choose.",
      "The Understage fills with half-finished narratives, with stories that circle themselves endlessly, with characters caught in loops of near-resolution.",
      "Is this a punishment? Perhaps.",
      "Is this a mercy? Perhaps.",
      "Is this simply what happens when stories cannot end? Perhaps.",
      "The ghostlight cycles on. The machinery moves through its eternal pattern. The Editor waits, patient as stone, for the choice that never comes.",
      "You are the Prompter forever. And every story is always about to end.",
