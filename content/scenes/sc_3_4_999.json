      "The Editor studies you for a long moment. Their expression is unreadable, but you sense something like understanding—and perhaps something like relief.",
      "\"Very well,\" they say. \"The choice is deferred. But understand: nothing in the Understage remains static. The stories will continue. The factions will continue. The problems you were summoned to solve will not simply resolve themselves.\"",

      "\"Perhaps someone else will come. Perhaps you will return, when you are ready. Or perhaps the Understage will simply... continue. As it always has.\"",
      "The darkness grows thicker around you, but it is not threatening—simply the darkness of a theater after the final curtain has fallen. The quiet after the audience has gone home.",
      "The Understudy appears beside you, their form flickering like a candle that is about to go out.",
      "\"We're still here,\" they say quietly. \"The stories are still here. Nothing has ended. But nothing has been resolved, either.\"",
      "They look around at the dimming theater, at the manuscript that sits closed on its desk.",
      "\"I suppose that's its own kind of ending. Not a conclusion, but a pause. Not a resolution, but a rest.\"",
      "The spotlight has narrowed to a single point—the light above the Editor's desk. Beyond it, the corridors of the Understage stretch into darkness, waiting for the next traveler, the next choice, the next story.",
      "You feel a strange sensation: the sense of a loop beginning again, of actors returning to their starting positions, of a stage being prepared for another performance.",
      "\"Will you try again?\" the Understudy asks. \"Or will this be where your story ends?\"",
      "The question hangs in the darkness, unanswered.",
