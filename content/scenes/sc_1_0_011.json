      "You sprint after the figure, but the corridor shifts with every step. Doors appear and vanish. The walls curve when they should be straight. This is narrative space—malleable, responsive to the story being told.",
      "Ahead, the figure stops. You skid to a halt.",
      "It's not alone. Two more figures emerge from the shadows—a hero with a sword that glows with fading plot armor, and a villain whose monologue echoes as if spoken a thousand times.",
      "\"The Prompter,\" the escaped figure says. Their voice cracks like dialogue from an unread draft. \"We heard about you. The one who guides stories. The one who decides.\"",
      "\"We're tired of being characters,\" the hero says, but their eyes are empty. \"We want to be real.\"",
      "\"But the Editor won't let us,\" the villain adds. \"So we run. We hide. We wait.\"",
      "They surround you. The corridor narrows. You sense this isn't a confrontation—it's a test. They want to know if you're worthy of the title you carry.",
      "\"Will you help us cross?\" the escaped figure asks. \"Or will you send us back to our stories?\""
