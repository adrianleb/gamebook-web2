      "The Prop Room is smaller than the Stacks, but its contents are somehow more haunting. Shelves line every wall, displaying objects from stories that no longer exist.",
      "A sword with a blade made of glass sits on a pedestal. A tag reads: *From the unwritten sequel where heroes became villains.* When you look closely, you see your own reflection transformed—wearing armor you've never worn, holding the glass sword with practiced ease.",
      "A music box rests on a nearby shelf, its lid closed. Without opening it, you can hear the melody—a lullaby from a story that was abandoned before anyone could fall asleep to it. The tune is beautiful and impossibly sad.",
      "In a glass case, a crown woven from dried flowers. The tag reads: *For the queen who was cut from the final draft.* The flowers crumble slightly when you exhale, as if even your breath accelerates their decay.",
      "A collection of photographs shows people you've never met but somehow recognize—characters who never made it past chapter one, their faces familiar from versions of stories that were never published. They smile from the frames, frozen in moments that never happened.",
      "An open book lies on a central table. The pages are blank, but when you stare at them, words flicker in and out of existence—whole scenes appearing and vanishing before you can read them. A story trying to write itself, over and over, unable to begin.",
      "CHORUS whispers from the corners of the room: \"*Every object here is a ghost. Every prop remembers the hand that held it, the scene that gave it purpose. The Editor takes stories, but leaves behind what cannot be unmade. These remain. They wait. They hope.*\"",
      "You realize that these objects are more than remnants—they are evidence. Proof of what has been lost. And perhaps, if gathered together, they could be used to restore what was taken."
