      "The Prop Room is a cavernous space filled with the debris of abandoned narratives. Racks of costumes hang from the ceiling like ghosts of unworn clothing. Shelves groan under the weight of objects that once mattered deeply to stories that no longer exist.",
      "You pass a crown made of glass that shatters if you look at it directly—the artifact of a fairy tale cut from the final draft. Beside it sits a child's stuffed bear, one eye missing, waiting in a story that was never finished.",
      "A sword hangs on the wall, its blade inscribed with prophecies that were never fulfilled. The metal hums faintly, as if still expecting a battle that will never come. You resist the urge to touch it—some objects remember their purpose too keenly.",
      "In one corner, you find a collection of letters tied with ribbon. Love letters from a romance that ended before the confession scene. Farewell notes from a tragedy where no one died. The handwriting is beautiful, the words carefully chosen, all of it wasted.",
      "A mirror hangs crookedly on one wall. When you glance into it, you don't see your reflection—you see a different version of yourself, wearing clothes you've never owned, standing in a room you've never visited. The mirror shows who you might have been in a story that was never written about you.",
      "On a workbench in the center of the room, someone has arranged items in careful patterns: a key, a flower, a knife, a locket, a single playing card. Each object represents a choice that was never made, a path that was never taken. The arrangement feels like a message, but you can't quite read it.",
      "The Prop Room's air is thick with potential energy. Every object here is waiting to be used again, waiting for a story to give it meaning. Some have been waiting so long they've begun to fade, their edges blurring, their substance thinning.",
      "You find yourself reluctant to touch anything. These are the leftovers of other people's imagination, and it feels intrusive to disturb them.",
      "Yet something calls to you—a small object on a high shelf, almost hidden in shadow. It seems to recognize you somehow."
