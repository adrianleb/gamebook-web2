      "The Independent leads you through a door you hadn't noticed before—a plain rectangle of dark wood, unmarked and unassuming.",
      "The Council Chamber unfolds: a circular room with three equally-spaced doors, each painted in faction colors. At the center stands a round table, scarred by years of argument and compromise.",
      "Three figures are already there—one in Preservationist blue, one in Revisionist red, one in Exiter green. They're not sitting. They're standing at the table, locked in a stalemate of glare and gesture.",
      "\"Another mediator,\" the Preservationist says, disappointment heavy in their voice. \"We've tried this. They all take sides eventually.\"",
      "\"Because some sides are RIGHT,\" the Revisionist snaps. \"Stories cannot be preserved in amber. They must grow. Change. EVOLVE.\"",
      "\"And some must END,\" the Exiter adds quietly. \"Not all stories deserve to continue. Not all characters deserve to be trapped in narratives they never chose.\"",
      "The Independent gestures for you to take your place at the table. \"This is the Council of Three. Each faction sends a representative. Each represents a truth about stories. And all three truths are necessary—even when they contradict.\"",
      "\"The Preservationists protect what was written. The Revisionists fight for what could be written. The Exiters demand the freedom to leave stories entirely. The Council exists so they can talk instead of fight.\"",
      "The Independent meets your eyes. \"Most mediators fail. They pick a favorite. They get frustrated. They realize balance is exhausting work with no clear victories. But you... you might be different.\"",
      "Around the table, the three representatives watch you with varying degrees of hope and suspicion.",
      "The Preservationist says, \"If you can keep the Archives safe from Revisionist vandalism, we'll listen.\"",
      "The Revisionist says, \"If you can recognize that some stories NEED fixing, we'll work with you.\"",
      "The Exiter says, \"If you can understand that freedom matters more than perfection, we'll trust you.\"",
      "The Independent smiles faintly. \"And there's the challenge. Find the third option that honors all three. Fail, and the Council collapses. Succeed, and you might just hold the Understage together.\"",
      "The Council of Three waits for your first act as mediator."
