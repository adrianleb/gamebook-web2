      "You walk alone toward the desk at center stage. Each step echoes in the cavernous theater, the sound returning to you distorted—layer upon layer of footsteps, as if a crowd walks with you though you stand alone.",
      "The spotlight does not warm you. It feels cold, clinical, examining you like a specimen under glass. The shadows behind the desk writhe, taking shapes that dissolve when you try to focus on them.",
      "As you near the desk, you see that its surface is not empty. A single sheet of paper lies there, covered in dense script that changes each time you blink. Sometimes it's a list of names. Sometimes it's a map of the Understage with regions crossed out. Sometimes it's your own story, written in a hand you've never seen.",
      "A voice speaks from everywhere at once—the Editor's voice, vast and patient and utterly certain of its own rightness.",
      "\"You come alone. Brave. Or foolish. I cannot decide which.\"",
      "The shadows behind the desk coalesce into the suggestion of a figure, but never quite resolve. \"I am revising stories, Prompter. Eliminating suffering. Closing plot holes that have caused pain for generations. You've seen the Archives—you know what I speak of. Why preserve tragedies when joy can be written in their place?\"",
      "The paper on the desk flutters, and for a moment you see your own name among those crossed out.",
      "\"We will speak properly soon. But first—demonstrate your intent. Return to the entrance and choose your path with clarity. The solo approach requires certainty. Do you have it?\"",
      "The way back to the descent point shimmers with possibility. The path forward—to the final confrontation—wait for your decision."
