      "\"My failure?\" Maren's voice is soft, almost lost in the rustle of pages. \"I believed I could save everyone. Every story. Every character. I thought the Understage was a prison, and the Prompter was the liberator.\"",
      "They shake their head slowly. \"I was wrong. The Understage is not a prison. It is a sanctuary. Stories end because they must. Characters fade because their stories are complete. To force them to continue... that is the true cruelty.\"",
      "\"I reached the Final Confrontation with all the power of a hundred alliances. Every faction supported me. Every door was open. And when the Editor offered me the choice... I could not choose. I could not accept that some stories must end.\"",
      "\"So I did nothing. I refused the choice. The Editor laughed—not with cruelty, but with terrible understanding. They said: 'Then you shall remain, until you understand what you refuse to accept.'\"",
      "Maren's form shimmers in the candlelight. For a moment, you see not a figure in shadow, but a young Prompter standing at the edge of an endless stage, surrounded by stories that cannot end.",
      "\"Three centuries I have waited. Three hundred Prompters I have guided. And do you know what I have learned?\"",
      "They lean forward, and for the first time, their features stabilize—you see a face lined with wisdom, with compassion, with grief.",
      "\"The brave choice is not to save everything. The brave choice is to accept that some things must be lost. The brave choice is to end well what cannot continue.\"",
      "Maren sits back, returning to shadow. \"But you are not me. Perhaps you will find another way. Perhaps you will succeed where I failed. Or perhaps... you will learn the same lesson, in your own time.\"",
      "The handbook closes with finality. The candle burns low. Your path awaits."
