      "A large cork board mounted on the far wall catches your eye. Tacked to its surface are notices, requests, and fragments of stories-in-progress—messages from characters seeking something or offering knowledge.",
      "One notice, written in elegant cursive on yellowed parchment, reads: *\"Seeking those who remember the world before revisions. Meet in The Archives. Ask for The Understudy.\"*",
      "Another, scrawled in hurried charcoal: *\"The Editor's agents grow bold. If you value stories as they were written, seek allies among the Preservationists in The Archives.\"*",
      "A smaller card, almost hidden beneath layers of other notices: *\"Not all stories deserve to be preserved. Some cause only suffering. Join us in The Mainstage—we are making something better.\"* This one bears no signature, but the ink shimmers oddly when you look directly at it.",
      "A final note, written in a hand that seems to change with every word: *\"The boundary between worlds grows thin. Soon, characters may walk among you. Is this not what everyone wants? To meet their favorites? To live within stories? Find us in The Mainstage.\"*",
      "CHORUS speaks from the mirrors behind you: \"*Each faction seeks the Prompter's favor. Each believes their path serves stories best. The board changes daily. New postings appear. Old ones vanish. The Editor watches through them all.*\"",
      "You sense that these notices are more than paper and ink—they are invitations, warnings, and opportunities. The choice of how to respond, or whether to respond at all, remains yours."
