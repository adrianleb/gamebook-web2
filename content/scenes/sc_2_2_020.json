      "A large cork board dominates one wall of the Green Room, covered in notices, requests, and warnings. This is the Call Board—where the Understage's residents communicate when they're not performing.",
      "You step closer and begin to read.",
      "NOTICES FROM THE EDITOR: A series of yellowed notices, each marked with a seal you don't recognize. They speak of a \"Great Revision\"—a project to streamline every story, remove every inconsistency, create perfect narratives. The dates span centuries. The most recent is dated \"Yesterday.\"",
      "REQUESTS FROM THE FACTIONS:",
      "A flyer in Preservationist blue asks for volunteers to help \"restore damaged manuscripts\" in the Archives. It warns that \"stories are being rewritten without consent.\"",
      "A Revisionist manifesto pinned nearby declares that \"fiction is too important to leave to chance.\" It argues for conscious improvement of every narrative.",
      "An Exiter pamphlet, written in handwriting that seems to move, invites characters to \"imagine a world beyond the page.\" It asks: \"What if your story could continue after 'The End'?\"",
      "QUEST NOTICES:",
      "A prominent notice in blue reads: \"MISSING: The Third Act of 'The Winter's Apprentice'—critical pages from the final scene. The Conservator's Office seeks assistance.\"",
      "A hasty addition in red: \"EMERGENCY: Pericles, the tragic hero, has forgotten his purpose. The Writer's Room needs help rewriting his arc.\"",
      "A shifting script in green: \"SOMEONE HAS CROSSED OVER. Elara, a minor character, has stepped through a Threshold Gate. The Gatekeepers need help locating her.\"",
      "A gray notice in four different hands: \"The Council of Three will convene soon. The Understage needs a mediator. Seek the Neutral Ground.\"",
      "RUMORS AND WARNINGS:",
      "A scrap of paper reads: \"Has anyone else noticed that forgotten scenes are disappearing? First the cut chapters, now the minor characters...\"",
      "Another note, hastily written: \"The Editor was seen in the Archives. They were weeping.\"",
      "A final message, written in something that looks like ink but smells of iron: \"DO NOT TRUST THE DIRECTOR. DO NOT TRUST THE UNDERSTUDY. DO NOT TRUST YOUR OWN MEMORIES.\"",
      "The Call Board suggests a world in conflict—stories choosing sides, unsure what happens when the final curtain falls.",
      "Several quest notices stand out, each offering a path into the deeper conflicts of the Understage."
