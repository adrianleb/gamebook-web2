      "A large cork board dominates one wall of the Green Room, covered in notices, requests, and warnings. This is the Call Board—where the Understage's residents communicate when they're not performing.",
      "You step closer and begin to read.",
      "NOTICES FROM THE EDITOR: A series of yellowed notices, each marked with a seal you don't recognize. They speak of a \"Great Revision\"—a project to streamline every story, remove every inconsistency, create perfect narratives. The dates span centuries. The most recent is dated \"Yesterday.\"",
      "REQUESTS FROM THE FACTIONS:",
      "A flyer in Preservationist blue asks for volunteers to help \"restore damaged manuscripts\" in the Archives. It warns that \"stories are being rewritten without consent.\"",
      "A Revisionist manifesto pinned nearby declares that \"fiction is too important to leave to chance.\" It argues for conscious improvement of every narrative.",
      "An Exiter pamphlet, written in handwriting that seems to move, invites characters to \"imagine a world beyond the page.\" It asks: \"What if your story could continue after 'The End'?\"",
      "RUMORS AND WARNINGS:",
      "A scrap of paper reads: \"Has anyone else noticed that forgotten scenes are disappearing? First the cut chapters, now the minor characters...\"",
      "Another note, hastily written: \"The Editor was seen in the Archives. They were weeping.\"",
      "A final message, written in something that looks like ink but smells of iron: \"DO NOT TRUST THE DIRECTOR. DO NOT TRUST THE UNDERSTUDY. DO NOT TRUST YOUR OWN MEMORIES.\"",
      "The Call Board suggests a world in conflict—stories choosing sides, unsure what happens when the final curtain falls.",
      "You step back, the weight of what you've learned settling in."
