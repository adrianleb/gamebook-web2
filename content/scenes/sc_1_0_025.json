      "You feel it—the resistance. The boundary between worlds is not easily crossed. It demands something of you.",
      "\"The First Crossing is the hardest,\" Maren says from behind you. \"Once you cross, there is no return to who you were. The Understage changes everyone who enters it. Some become stronger. Some break. Some become something else entirely.\"",
      "They step closer, but not too close. They will not follow. Not yet.",
      "\"Before you cross, know this: the stories you guide will depend on you. They will look to you for direction, for meaning, for resolution. But they are not yours to control. They are yours to guide. There is a difference.\"",
      "Maren's voice softens. \"I have watched three hundred Prompters stand where you stand now. Some crossed with courage. Some crossed with fear. Some crossed with pride. All of them crossed, because there was no other way.\"",
      "\"The First Crossing awaits. When you are ready, step into the darkness. The stories will not tell themselves.\"",
      "The empty seats watch. The stage marks beneath your feet remember those who came before. The darkness waits.",
      "What path will you take to cross?"
